## CFG Presentation Takeaway

### What went well?

- I really enjoy CSS and love making things aesthetically pleasing, so it was rewarding to build something that looked like an actual website.

### What were the challenges?

- I struggled with JavaScript until I realized I wasnt linking to my JS files, & the navbar gave me some issues. 

### How will you expand your current project?

- I need to add more JavaScript and interactive elements to the website. Possibly building out the careers page more as well.
